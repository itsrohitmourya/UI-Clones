# 🔥 Daily UI Clone Challenge

Welcome to my **Daily UI Clone Challenge** — a collection of beautifully recreated UIs inspired by real-world apps and websites. The goal is simple: **build one UI clone every day**, focusing purely on front-end skills, visuals, animations, and layout techniques.

## 🌟 Why This Repo?

I’m sharpening my front-end design and development skills by cloning well-known UIs using:
- 🧱 **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS**
- 🎞 **Framer Motion**
- 📦 Other libraries & tools I want to explore

No backend. No databases. **Just pure front-end magic.**

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder contains:
- 🔹 A specific UI clone (e.g., `spotify-clone`, `linkedin-login`)
- 🔹 `index.html`, `style.css`, and/or JS files
- 🔹 A `preview.png` or `screenshot.gif` for visual reference
- 🔹 Modern tech like Tailwind, animations, or UI libraries where applicable
